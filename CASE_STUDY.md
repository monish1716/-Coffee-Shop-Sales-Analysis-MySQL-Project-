#  Coffee Shop Sales Analysis – Detailed Case Study

##  Problem
The coffee shop struggled to understand sales across time, products, and locations. Goals: identify top items, pinpoint peak days/hours, and inform targeted operational decisions.

##  Data
- Source: `Coffee Shop Sales.csv` (~140k+ entries — large enough for reliable analysis)
- Key fields: date-time, product category, location, quantity, sales, order ID.

##  Approach
1. Data cleaning & transformation via MySQL.
2. KPI computations: Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Quantity, MoM growth.
3. Trends by day/weekend, hours, locations, product categories.
4. Dashboard visualized in Power BI — interactive narrative.
